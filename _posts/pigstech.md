## Project

Improve the Pig-farming industryâ€™s productivity as well as animal health and living conditions by implementing a full-stack solution from IoT-sensors infrastructure, to Edge Gateway, finally to Cloud implementing Machine Learning solutions.

## Challenge

### Background

PigsTech founders have identified a real issue in the pigs farming industry that a combinaison of IoT and software coupled with artificial intelligence can tackle. 

Indeed, every year, pigs and piglets become ill, sometimes worst due to a lack of  monitoring. The solution proposed will enable farm managers and employees to track in real time the health of their animals.

### Mission

Pixium is responsible to process a live stream data feed from the animals using a combination of edge and cloud computing and deliver (through a mobile application) some insights based on a repository of scientific articles.

## Solution

IoT System security & IT infrastructure deployment (AWS serverless)

Scraper and associated repository of scientific articles on Pig Health and farms KPI

Edge computing for web and mobile application and machine learning algorithms dev on IOT data benchmarked to Scientific Repository
