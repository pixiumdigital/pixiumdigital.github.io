## Project

We developed an innovative augmented reality (AR) mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms, revolutionizing the way users envision furniture in their spaces. This application empowers users to seamlessly add virtual furniture to real-world environments using advanced AR technology.

Key features include:
<ul>
    <li>Precise Object Placement: Users can accurately position, resize, and rotate virtual furniture within their physical spaces.</li>
    <li>Immersive Realism: High-quality 3D models and textures ensure a lifelike representation of furniture items, enhancing the visualization experience.</li>
    <li>Intuitive User Experience: A user-friendly interface designed to cater to all skill levels, making AR accessible and enjoyable.</li>
</ul>

The application combines cutting-edge AR frameworks with robust mobile development practices, offering a dynamic tool for interior design, furniture shopping, and spatial planning. It is a testament to our expertise in blending creativity with technology to deliver solutions that enhance everyday experiences.
