## Project

ZilBingo is a decentralized Bingo game that brings innovation to a classic pastime by leveraging blockchain technology. Players can buy, sell, and trade their Bingo cards, which are represented as unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), making each card a valuable digital asset.

In early 2021, the ZilBingo team partnered with Pixium to bring their vision of a blockchain-based Bingo game to life. Pixium began by conducting a thorough evaluation of blockchain layers to identify the optimal solution in terms of transaction cost, scalability, and smart contract functionality to align with the gameâ€™s requirements. This careful groundwork ensured a seamless integration of blockchain features.

Development officially kicked off in April 2021, marking the start of an exciting journey to combine entertainment with the cutting-edge potential of decentralized technology.
