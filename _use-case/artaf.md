## Project

The ArtAF app offers access to works of art from #GBK85 exhibition and allows the user to view the artworks not only from the comfort of their own homes, but also “hanging” on their walls. This AR technology feature offers a new dimension on Mr Goh Beng Kwan’s artworks while giving the users a fresh perspective and a new means of engaging with the art.

## Challenge

### Background

ARTAF AR mobile application was developed for the 10-day exhibition that combines physical and AR art, a comprehensive retrospective of one of Singapore’s living legends of modern art – Goh Beng Kwan. He turns 85 this year, making him one of the rare artists of his generation who is still actively creating art. Mr. Goh is best known for his mixed medium abstract collages and his time-bending creative versatility which explores issues around Cultural Representation, Urbanism and Identity.

### Mission

Development of both iOS and Android AR mobile applications allowing architect and interior designer to showcase and edit in real time their art pieces composition and layout. 

## Solution

The app provides a heightened experience of the ArtAF Art Exhibition at Conrad Centennial, revealing 15 Art pieces through AR only. It also allows the users to preview the 85 pieces presented via AR, in the comfort of their own homes.
